# Greengrass oriented subdirectory

This directory does basically the same thing as the IoT directory, but in
much more complicated fashion.
It does not actually save the output, but only sends it as DEBUG
output to the logfile, and stops, at present.

You should probably just go to the IoT subdirectory instead.
This code remains, because it took literally days to find out the full
working combination. To lose that knowledge would be a sad thing
